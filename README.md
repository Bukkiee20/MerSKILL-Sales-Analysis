# MerSKILL-Sales-Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aim to provide insights into the sales performance of a company over the past years. By analyzing various aspect of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, top-selling products and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

### Data Source
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Sales Data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools
- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning
- MySQL Workbench - Data Analysis
- Microsoft PowerBI - Creating Reports/Dashboard

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are the top sellers and worst sellers?
- What are the peak sales period?
- In which cities do we observe the highest sales figures for our products?

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The Macbook Pro Laptop takes the lead as our best-selling product with a total sales figure of $8.0M. This dominance is clearly reflected in the Average Order Value chart, where it claims the top spot,indicating that customers tend to make larger single purchases of this product. Following closely behind is the iPhone, with sales totaling $4.8M, and the ThinkPad Laptop at $4.1 million. In contrast,AAA Batteries (4-pack) ranks as our lowest-selling product
2. Despite AAA Batteries (4-pack) having the lowest sales, it was the most ordered product, with an impressive quantity of 31,000 units sold. Additionally, in terms of city-wise sales, San Franciscostands out as the leader with sales of $8.26M, followed by Los Angeles with $5.45M and New York City with $4.66M in sales. On the other hand, Austin recorded the lowest sales, totaling $1.82M.
3. Quarter 1 stood out with the lowest recorded sales at $6.8M, while Quarter 4 marked the pinnacle with $11.5M in sales. It's worth noting that the final three months of the year (October, Novemberand December) with December being the highest with $4.6M in sales saw a significant upswing in revenue. Tuesday, in particular, emerged as the top-performing day with $5.09M in sales surpassing allother days of the week.
4. The business consistently encounters its peak periods between the hours of 11am-1pm and then recurring from 6pm-8pm. During these specific time frames, we consistently observe a significant surge in order placements signifying the prime hours of customer activity.

### Recommendations
1. **Leverage Macbook Pro's Success:** Given the Macbook Pro Laptop's exceptional sales and high average order value, consider introducing complementary products or accessories that can be bundled
with Macbook Pro Laptop purchases to further boost sales and increase revenue.
2. **Promotion for ThinkPad Laptop:** The ThinkPad Laptop is performing well as it ranks second based on average order value, but there's room for growth. Implement targeted marketing campaigns or
promotions to capitalize on its popularity and potentially surpass iPhone sales.
3. Build on the success of Tuesdays as the highest revenue day. Run targeted promotions or campaigns on Tuesdays to maintain or increase sales on this day.
4. **Optimize Operating Hours:** Given the observed peak order hours from 11am to 1pm and 6pm to 8pm, ensure that the business is adequately staffed and prepared during these periods to provide
the best customer experience. In addition, consider offering promotions or special deals during these peak hours to further encourage customer activity and spending.
5. **AAA Batteries Optimization:** Despite being the lowest in sales revenue, AAA Batteries (4-pack) is highly ordered. Consider bundling these batteries with other products or offering special deals to
increase their sales value.
